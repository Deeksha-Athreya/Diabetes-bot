# Diabetes_Prediction-bot

## What is it?
This bot helps in predicting if a woman above the age of 21 has diabetes or not depending on various factors such as number of pregencies,insuline level,skin thickness ect.
It uses built in libraries of Python such as numpy,mathplotlib,rainforestclustering ect.

## Future upgrade:
Currently only the trained ML bot is present. I would like to add a user interface in the future so that this data can directly be taken from the patients medical certificate when uploaded or scanned.
I would also like to work on improving the accuracy of this bot
